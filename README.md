# Diamonds
In this project I performed analyzing and prediction on diamonds dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivam2503/diamonds).
There I solved classification and price regression tasks. During my work I did EDA and researched different models to obtain the better results.
In my work there are used methods of supervised learning like Linear, Logistic Regression (with various regularization techniques), SVM, Desion Tree and unsupervised learning like kNN and some methods of scaling.
Also I used ensembles like Random Forest, XGBoost, LGBoost with GridSearch and RandomizedSearch to obtain the best results.
